# readout
A tool for inserting markdown content into your site as HTML.

This project is early in its development. The premise is that when it comes to writing actual content, you probably don't need anything besides markdown. As a huge fan of it, I'd like to be able to write all of my "word-stuff" in good ol' markdown, but insert it nicely into a page.

**To see an example:** view a readout of this README on the [readout site](http://asimpletune.github.io/readout/).
